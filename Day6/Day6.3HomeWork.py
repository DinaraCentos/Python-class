#As a user I want to be able to type long sentence.

#b) The script should ask me input to replace word in text like > inputWordToReplace: early:lately

#Ex:
#Please enter sentence: The breaking day was shimmering with the buzz of nature going about its business. Breathing in, I felt awakened by the delicate bite of the early spring air. Breathing out, I felt my warm breath rise like a morning prayer. There was nothing special going on, only gently bubbling stillness and beauty all around. A moment of peace. I felt grateful to be present and noticing.
